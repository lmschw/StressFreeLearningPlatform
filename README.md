# StressFreeLearningPlatform

Welcome to the platform version of the Stress Free Learning project. Originally conceived as a swarm robotics test for dyslexia, it has evolved through multiple stages to this exciting form! 

**Summary**  
An estimated 20% of people are affected by learning difficulties (varies from country to country and source to source). While a lot of awareness has been raised in the last few years, there is still no platform for affected people - parents, teachers, testers and researchers - to come together and share their experiences. That's what we're aiming to provide. Combining practical experience and research into a community will hopefully make a difference. More details to come in the wiki.

**Plan**  
We're still in stage 1 of the project, i.e. preparations. The detailed plan can be found in the wiki.

**How to use**  
For now, there isn't much so it is not usable at the minute. We'll keep you posted.

**Contributions**  
If you feel like contributing to the project, feel free to get in touch. We're friendly, don't worry. We only bite under very specific circumstances. 

**Original projects**  
If you're curious where we've started out from, then feel free to explore the following repos: https://github.com/easyadin/sfl for the original testing website and  https://github.com/lmschw/SwarmLinguisticOrder for the swarm robotics implementation.
